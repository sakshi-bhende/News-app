#newsapp
 Developing a NewsApp using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, integrating news data from a
 free API along with user-generated content from Editors and Readers. Implemented JWT authentication and Role
Based Access Control (RBAC) for user management, allowing Admins and Editors to add, edit, and approve news,
 while Readers can submit and read content. Built a robust news approval workflow, ensuring secure and seamless
 content management with a dynamic and responsive user interface
